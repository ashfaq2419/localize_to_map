## 📦 Initial Setup — First Time Push

I created a repository on my GitHub, and then ran the following commands to push the code:

```bash
echo "# localize_to_map" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ashfaq2419/localize_to_map.git
git push -u origin main


## 🔄 Daily Workflow — Push Updates to GitHub

Every time when a change needs to be committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
